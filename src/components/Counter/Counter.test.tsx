  // Note ðŸ’¡: Acc to testing-library/react, it is recommended to use "getByTestId" only after the other queries don't work for your use case.
  // Reason ðŸ’¡: Because, your actual code now has an additional "data-testid" attribute, whose purpose is only to be used in tests and does not play any role in the component's logic.
  // Pros âœ…: But, they are way better than selecting elements using css selectors because, css selectors can change often when CSS styles change.
